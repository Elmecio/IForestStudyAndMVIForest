    "La question est donc de savoir ce qui importe le plus entre la découverte des anomalies et celle des observations normales car c'est en fonction de l'importance que nous donnons à l'un ou à l'autre que nous pourront dire la méthode la meilleure entre OC-SVM et LOF.\n",
    "Cette question fait remarquer qu'en réalité, toutes les méthodes ont sont performantes dans des conditions données en fonction de ce que l'on souhaite obtenir comme résultat. Dans ce cas précis, OC-SVM lance beaucoup de fausse alertes mais attrappe beaucoup d'anomalies. Par contre, LOF n'attrappe pas beaucoup d'anomalies mais reconnais beaucoup de données normales.\n",
    "On peut peut-être se dire que dans le cas espèce OC-SVM est mieux dans la mesure où une méthode de détection d'anomalies a pour but principal de détecter les anomalies et donc laisser passer des anomalies en ferait une méthode moins bonne et que les observations normales que OC-SVM aurait classé comme anormales sont peut être des nouveautés.\n",

    "La courbe ROC mesurant le taux de faux positif par rapport au taux de vrai positif, plus la courbe s'éloigne de celle oblique en noir, mieux c'est.\n",
    "Ainsi, on peut dire que pour Shuttle, IForest est la meilleure méthode de détection d'anomalies suivi par OC-SVM. Le classement de LOF pourrait s'expliquer par le fait que les anomalies qui y sont présentes sont des anomalies global alors que LOF est doué pour les anomalies locales. POur vérifier ça peut être qu'on peut utiliser une méthode de clustering comme K-means pour voir comment les anomalies seront classées par cette méthode."

    "## Conclusion Shuttle\n",
    "Pour un jeu de données statique de faible dimension, Isolation forest a tendance à mieux performer et semble être plus rapide que OC-SVM et LOF. OC-SVM détecte beaucoup d'anomalies avec un fort taux de fausses alertes et un temps d'exécution plus grand que LOF. Par contre, LOF détecte moins d'anomalies avec un faible taux de fausses alertes.\n",
    "Notons que la performance des méthodes dépends non seulement du jeu de données considéré mais aussi des valeurs des hypermaramètres. Pour LOF et IsolationForest, le temps d'exécution semble être en correlation positive avec respectivement le nombre de voisins et nombre de d'estimateurs. Par contre, le temps d'exécution serait en correlation négative avec nu."
